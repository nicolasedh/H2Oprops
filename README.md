Installation notes. If you have python just run
python H2Oprops.py

To create a windows executable make sure you have py2exe
installed. Run 
python setup.py py2exe

and it should create an executable under dist

py2exe is not included in winpython by default but can be downloaded.
Installing py2exe is easier if you "regiestered" winpython to windows
